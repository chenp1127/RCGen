      `1. You’ll Save Time
      Instead of wasting time trying to figure out what to cook, or whether you should order takeout, meal prepping assures that you always have a little meal waiting patiently for you on your lunch break or when you arrive home. And, don’t forget the most important factor: Meal prepping means fewer dishes.
      
      2. You’ll Have More Dough In Your Pocket
      Eating healthy tends to get a bad reputation for being overly expensive. But meal prepping saves money because you can buy ingredients in bulk, freeze extra food for later, and most importantly, spend less money eating out.

      3. You Can Better Manage Your Portion Sizes
      It’s simple really. Restaurants tend to give us more than the suggested portion size. So many people are overeating each day and consuming more calories than necessary to maintain a healthy diet. When you prepare your own food, you’re able to control your portions, and you know exactly what ingredients you’re putting in your body. Because of this, meal prepping has become the new go-to habit for reaching your weight goals.
      
      4. You Might Lower Your Stress Levels
      Figuring out what to make for dinner may seem harmless, but for some people, struggling with this every day can be stressful and overwhelming. When you meal prep for the week, you don’t have to engage in that battle every day.
      
      5. You’ll Gain A New Handy Skill
      If you want to be more confident in the kitchen, meal prepping can be a great teacher. Meal prepping might help you find your way around the kitchen and open up a world of new recipes—from making roasted chicken and veggies to taco chili in a pressure cooker.
      
      6. You’ll Create A Better Relationship With Food
      When you meal prep, you learn more about nutrition and how to treat food for what it is: energy and nutrients. You learn to eat only when you’re hungry instead of making unwise decisions in a rush.

      7. You’ll Inspire Others
      Let’s face it, when you see someone doing something inspiring, it can spark some action in you as well. When other people see you leading a healthy lifestyle, it might inspire them to make healthy changes too, even if they’re small.
      
      Meal prepping might take some getting used to, but it’s a step in the right direction toward being a healthier you. And you might find that it will become a favorite new habit. Want to try it out? Here’s a tool to help you get started.

    content: `What Are Nuts?
    This may seem ridiculously basic, but most people actually don’t know if nuts are fruits or vegetables or some sort of meat hybrid. It may surprise you to learn that people don’t exactly agree on what precisely nuts are. Some believe nuts are fruits and others believe they’re in a class all to themselves. The truth is that different nuts have different classifications. Almonds, for instance, are tree nuts, while peanuts are legumes. It gets messy, but if you have a nut allergy, stay away from all of them.
    
    Don’t Nuts Have A Whole Bunch Of Protein In Them?
    An ounce of cashews has about 5 grams of protein and an ounce of peanuts has about 7 grams of protein. That’s about the same as an ounce of beef. And it’s a whole lot easier to carry around a handful of nuts than it is to carry around a hamburger patty.
    
     The benefits of eating nuts, peanuts, almonds, cashews, walnuts
    
    So Nuts Are Healthy! Does That Mean I Can Eat As Many As I Want?
    There’s no better way to ruin a healthy food choice than by eating too much of a healthy food choice. Nuts are a great source of protein and fat, but they also have quite a few calories. A cup of almonds, for instance, is roughly 530 calories. That’s about one-quarter of the recommended dietary intake for the average man. On the other hand, you can have an entire cup of strawberries, and it will only be approximately 47 calories.
    
    Oh. So How Many Nuts Should I Eat?
    If you’re looking to stay within average dietary guidelines, it’s best to have about an ounce of nuts as a snack once a day.
    
    Which Nuts Are Best?
    That depends on what you’re looking for. Here’s a breakdown of the type of nut you’ll want to eat depending on your goals:
    
    If your goal is to lose weight—All nuts are about the same in terms of calories, but preparation can make or break a diet along with how many nuts you eat. Make sure the nuts you’re eating are raw or dry roasted in salt— stay away from artificial flavorings and (even though they’re absolutely delicious) honey roasted nuts, which have added sugar and unnecessary carbs.
    
    Related: Building a Healthy Plate
    
    If you want to help your heart—Meet the almond, a nut that contains Alpha-lipoic acid or, a type of omega-3 fatty acid found in plants. Alpha-lipoic acid helps lower cholesterol and is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Plus, studies show that ALA helps lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity.
    
    If you want to support your brain—Hello, peanuts! Peanuts are high in folate, a great mineral for brain development.
    
    If you want to protect against disease—Almonds have the most calcium of any nut, which helps prevent bone deterioration. However, they’re also high in fiber and vitamin E, both valuable in combating inflammation.
    
    Now you know why we’re all nuts about nuts—they’re powerful, transportable, delicious little wonders.

      "10 superfoods to boost a healthy diet",
    intro:
      "No single food — not even a superfood — can offer all the nutrition, health benefits, and energy we need to nourish ourselves.",
    date: "July 1, 2023",
    author: "Katherine D. McManus",
    id: superfoods,
    content: `No single food — not even a superfood — can offer all the nutrition, health benefits, and energy we need to nourish ourselves. The 2015–2020 US Dietary Guidelines recommend healthy eating patterns, "combining healthy choices from across all food groups — while paying attention to calorie limits."

    Over the years, research has shown that healthy dietary patterns can reduce risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Dietary patterns such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet, which are mostly plant-based, have demonstrated significant health benefits and reduction of chronic disease.
    
    However, there are a few foods that can be singled out for special recognition. These "superfoods" offer some very important nutrients that can power-pack your meals and snacks, and further enhance a healthy eating pattern.
    
    Superfoods list
    Berries. High in fiber, berries are naturally sweet, and their rich colors mean they are high in antioxidants and disease-fighting nutrients.
    
    How to include them: When berries are not in season, it is just as healthy to buy them frozen. Add to yogurt, cereals, and smoothies, or eat plain for a snack.
    
    Fish. Fish can be a good source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, which help prevent heart disease.
    
    How to include it: Buy fresh, frozen, or canned fish. Fish with the highest omega-3 content are salmon, tuna steaks, mackerel, herring, trout, anchovies, and sardines.
    
    Leafy greens. Dark, leafy greens are a good source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium, as well as several phytochemicals (chemicals made by plants that have a positive effect on your health). They also add fiber into the diet.
    
    How to include them: Try varieties such as spinach, swiss chard, kale, collard greens, or mustard greens. Throw them into salads or sauté them in a little olive oil. You can also add greens to soups and stews.
    
    Nuts. Hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, pecans — nuts are a good source of plant protein. They also contain monounsaturated fats, which may be a factor in reducing the risk of heart disease.
    
    How to include them: Add a handful to oatmeal or yogurt or have as a snack. But remember they are calorically dense, so limit to a small handful. Try the various types of nut butters such as peanut (technically a legume), almond, or cashew. Nuts are also a great accompaniment to cooked veggies or salads.
    
    Olive oil. Olive oil is a good source of vitamin E, polyphenols, and monounsaturated fatty acids, all which help reduce the risk of heart disease.
    
    How to include it: Use in place of butter or margarine in pasta or rice dishes. Drizzle over vegetables, use as a dressing, or when sautéing.
    
    Whole grains. A good source of both soluble and insoluble fiber, whole grains also contain several B vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. They have been shown to lower cholesterol and protect against heart disease and diabetes.
    
    How to include them: Try having a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast. Substitute bulgur, quinoa, wheat berries, or brown rice for your usual baked potato. When buying breads at the supermarket, look to see that the first ingredient is "100% whole wheat flour."
    
    Yogurt. A good source of calcium and protein, yogurt also contains live cultures called probiotics. These "good bacteria" can protect the body from other, more harmful bacteria.
    
    How to include it: Try eating more yogurt, but watch out for fruited or flavored yogurts, which contain a lot of added sugar. Buy plain yogurt and add your own fruit. Look for yogurts that have "live active cultures" such as Lactobacillus, L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, and S. thermophilus. You can use yogurt in place of mayonnaise or sour cream in dips or sauces.
    
    Cruciferous vegetables. These include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, radishes, and turnips. They are an excellent source of fiber, vitamins, and phytochemicals including indoles, thiocyanates, and nitriles, which may prevent against some types of cancer.
    
    How to include them: Steam or stir-fry, adding healthy oils and herbs and seasonings for flavor. Try adding a frozen cruciferous vegetable medley to soups, casseroles, and pasta dishes.
    
    Legumes. This broad category includes kidney, black, red, and garbanzo beans, as well as soybeans and peas. Legumes are an excellent source of fiber, folate, and plant-based protein. Studies show they can help reduce the risk of heart disease.
    
    How to include them: Add to salads, soups, and casseroles. Make a chili or a bean- based spread such as hummus.
    
    Tomatoes. These are high in vitamin C and lycopene, which has been shown to reduce the risk of prostate cancer.
    
    How to include them: Try tomatoes in a salad or as a tomato sauce over your pasta. You can also put them in stews, soups, or chili. Lycopene becomes more available for your body to use when tomatoes are prepared and heated in a healthy fat such as olive oil.

      "Pre-teens and teenagers need a wide variety of foods from the five healthy food groups – vegetables, fruit, grains, dairy and protein.",
    date: "May 10, 2023",

    id: teenager,
    content: `Why older children and teenagers need healthy food and good nutrition
    Teenagers go through big physical changes in puberty. They need extra nutrition to fuel these physical changes, which means they need to eat healthy food.
    
    Your child’s level of physical activity and stage of development determine exactly how much healthy food they need. But you’ll notice your child has a bigger appetite, which is their body’s way of telling them to eat more.
    
    What is healthy food for older children and teenagers?
    Healthy food for pre-teen and teenage children includes a wide variety of fresh foods from the five food groups:
    
    1. vegetables
    2. fruit
    3. grain foods
    4. reduced-fat dairy or dairy-free alternatives
    5. protein

    Each food group has different nutrients, which your child’s body needs to grow and work properly. That’s why we need to eat a range of foods from across all five food groups.
    
    Fruit and vegetables
    Fruit and vegies give your child energy, vitamins, anti-oxidants, fibre, and water. These nutrients help protect your child against diseases later in life, including diseases like heart disease, stroke and some cancers.
    
    Encourage your child to choose fruit and vegetables at every meal and for snacks. This includes fruit and vegies of different colours, textures and tastes, both fresh and cooked.
    
    Wash fruit to remove dirt or chemicals, and leave any edible skin on, because the skin contains nutrients too.
    
    Grain foods
    Grain foods include bread, pasta, noodles, breakfast cereals, couscous, rice, corn, quinoa, polenta, oats and barley. These foods give your child the energy they need to grow, develop and learn.

    Grain foods with a low glycaemic index, like wholegrain pasta and breads, will give your child longer-lasting energy and keep them feeling fuller for longer.

    Reduced-fat dairy foods and dairy-free alternatives
    Key dairy foods are milk, cheese and yoghurt. These foods are good sources of calcium and protein.

    In puberty, your child needs more calcium to help them reach peak bone mass and build strong bones for life. So encourage your child to have different kinds of dairy each day – for example, drinks of milk, cheese slices, bowls of yoghurt and so on.

    If your child doesn’t eat dairy, it’s important for them to eat dairy-free foods that are rich in calcium – for example, tofu, kale, bok choy, nuts, seeds, tinned fish with bones, and calcium-fortified foods like cereal, soy milk and bread. Not all dairy alternatives are fortified with calcium, though, so make sure to read food labels.

    Protein
    Protein-rich foods include lean meat, fish, chicken, eggs, beans, lentils, chickpeas, tofu and nuts. These foods are important for your child’s growth and muscle development, especially during puberty.

    These protein-rich foods also have other vitamins and minerals like iron and omega-3 fatty acids, which are particularly important during adolescence:

    Omega-3 fatty acids from oily fish help with your child’s brain development and learning.
    Iron fuels your child’s muscle growth and increase in blood volume. Girls need extra iron because of their periods.
    Protein-rich foods from animal sources have zinc and vitamin B12 too.

    Healthy drinks for teenagers

    Water is the healthiest drink for your child. It’s also the cheapest. Most tap water is fortified with fluoride for strong teeth too.

    Reduced-fat milk is also a good drink option for teenagers. It’s rich in calcium, which is good for bone development.

    Foods and drinks to limit
    Encourage your child to limit the amount of ‘sometimes’ food they eat. This means your child will have more room for healthy, everyday foods.

    ‘Sometimes’ foods include fast food, takeaway and junk food like hot chips, potato chips, dim sims, pies, burgers, and takeaway pizza. They also include cakes, chocolate, lollies, biscuits, doughnuts and pastries.

    These foods can be high in salt, saturated fat and sugar, and low in fibre. If teenagers regularly eat these foods, it can increase their risk of teenage overweight and obesity and other health conditions like type-2 diabetes.

    Your child should limit sweet drinks like fruit juice, cordials, sports drinks, flavoured waters, soft drinks and flavoured milks. Sweet drinks are high in sugar and low in nutrients.

    Too many sweet drinks can lead to unhealthy weight gain, obesity and tooth decay. These drinks fill your child up and can make them less hungry for healthy meals.

    Foods and drinks with caffeine aren’t recommended for older children and teenagers because caffeine can affect how much calcium the body can absorb. Caffeine is also a stimulant, which means it gives children artificial energy. Too much caffeine can cause sleep problems as well as problems concentrating at school.

    Foods and drinks with caffeine include coffee, tea, energy drinks and chocolate.

    Healthy alternatives for snacks and desserts
    Encourage your child to choose snacks from the healthy food groups. This can include things like nuts, cheese, low-fat yoghurt and fresh fruit or vegetables – for example, carrot and celery sticks, rice cakes or wholegrain crackers with dips like hommus, guacamole o tzatziki.

    The same goes for dessert at the end of a meal. Sliced fruit or yoghurt are healthy options. If you want to serve something special, try homemade banana bread. Save the seriously sweet stuff, like cakes and chocolate, for special occasions like birthdays.

    content: `The Healthy Eating Food Pyramid
    Balanced diet is a key to stay healthy. Grains should be taken as the most. Eat more fruit and vegetables. Have a moderate amount of meat, fish, egg, milk and their alternatives. Reduce fat/ oil, salt and sugar. Trim fat from meat before cooking. Cook with low-fat methods such as steaming, stewing, simmering, boiling, scalding or cooking with non-stick frying pans. Also reduce the use of frying and deep-frying. These can help us achieve a balanced diet and promote health.
     
    How much of different kinds of food should I eat to stay healthy?
     
    Eat the Right Food
    Since different foods have different nutritional values, it is not possible to obtain all the nutrients we need from a single food. According to the Healthy Eating Food Pyramid, we have to eat a variety of foods among all food groups as well as within each group in order to get different nutrients and meet our daily needs.
     
    Eat the Right Amount
    Neither eating too much nor too little is good for our health. Every day, we need a specific amount of nutrients to maintain optimal health. If we do not eat enough, malnutrition or symptoms of nutrient deficiency are likely to develop. In contrast, excessive intake can result in over-nutrition and obesity. Therefore, we have to eat the right amount of food to stay healthy.
     
    Healthy Eating Food Pyramid
    Eat Most - Grains
    Eat More - Vegetables and fruits
    Eat Moderately - Meat, fish, egg and alternatives (including dry beans) and milk and alternatives
    Eat Less - Fat/ oil, salt and sugar
    Drink adequate amount of fluid (including water, tea, clear soup, etc) every day

    You may know the term "iodized salt" or recognize its packaging. Table salt is often fortified with iodine, which is important for producing thyroid hormones, according to the American Thyroid Association. If you don't have enough iodine, you may become at risk for an enlarged thyroid.
    
    Iodized salt is a great source of iodine and dissolves the quickest in food, making it ideal for most of your cooking and baking needs.
    
    Bottom line: One teaspoon of iodized salt contains about 2,360 milligrams of sodium (just above the recommended daily serving), according to the USDA. Use it in recipes with exact measurements and in the pasta water.

    You may know the term "iodized salt" or recognize its packaging. Table salt is often fortified with iodine, which is important for producing thyroid hormones, according to the American Thyroid Association. If you don't have enough iodine, you may become at risk for an enlarged thyroid.

    Iodized salt is a great source of iodine and dissolves the quickest in food, making it ideal for most of your cooking and baking needs.

    Bottom line: One teaspoon of iodized salt contains about 2,360 milligrams of sodium (just above the recommended daily serving), according to the USDA. Use it in recipes with exact measurements and in the pasta water.

    Sea Salt
    Sea salt comes from evaporated ocean water or saltwater lakes. Because sea salt is less processed than iodized salt, it 1) has less iodine but 2) retains small amounts of minerals like potassium.

    Sea salt has bigger granules than other types of salt, which can potentially mean more flavor for less sodium. But skip this briny salt in everyday cooking or baking since it doesn't dissolve easily, which can cause issues with the taste and texture of dishes. It's more fun to sprinkle it on top of your dishes.

    Bottom line: One teaspoon of sea salt has about 2,000 milligrams of sodium, according to the USDA. Try it as a flavorful garnish for soups, salads, and even chocolate chip cookies.
    
    Low-Sodium Salt
    Low-sodium salt is growing in popularity, but what exactly is it? It's sodium chloride (you know, salt) that has had some of its sodium replaced with potassium chloride, a mineral that tastes salty but is bitter when heated.

    While more research is needed to understand the full effects of low-sodium salt, a 2021 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed the potential for low-sodium salts to decrease rates of stroke, major cardiovascular events, and death. This study used a salt substitute that contained 75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride.

    Bottom line: Low-sodium salt may be a good alternative to table salt if you're trying to reduce your sodium intake. However, if you have kidney disease or take certain medications, the NIH recommends you speak to a health provider before using low-sodium salts with potassium chloride.

    Pink Himalayan Salt
    Pink Himalayan salt is mined in Pakistan near the Himalayas. You've maybe seen it at the dinner table in salt grinders, on a nightstand in a bedside lamp, or in spas, where "salt rooms" advertise non-dietary health benefits like stress or allergy relief.

    Pink Himalayan salt has slightly less sodium than table salt. It also has trace amounts of mineral elements (that help make it pink) like magnesium, zinc, iron, calcium, and potassium, but not enough to have an impact on your health.

    Pink Himalayan salt does have less iodine, which your body needs. The NIH notes that if you live in mountainous areas like the Himalayas, you are at risk for iodine deficiency unless you consume iodized salt.

    Importantly, not enough research supports the most popular health claims like stress, allergy, or muscle-soreness relief.

    Bottom line: A teaspoon of pink Himalayan salt has about 1,680 milligrams of sodium, according to the USDA. It may be a great addition to your meal. But we still need more research to understand the non-dietary benefits of pink Himalayan salt.

    content: `Calcium and vitamin D are two nutrients well-known to be important for bones. But there are many other vitamins, minerals and nutrients that are vital to help your bones stay healthy and strong.

    Try not to become too concerned with getting all these in your diet. If you enjoy a healthy, balanced diet, you're probably getting everything you need.
    
    A healthy, balanced diet
    This is all about eating meals that have foods from the four main food groups:
    
    fruit and vegetables
    carbohydrates, like bread, potatoes, pasta and cereals
    dairy and alternatives
    proteins, like beans, eggs, fish and meat
    For more information about these food groups and how much of each you need, take a look at The Eatwell Guide.

    Calcium
    Calcium gives your bones the strength and hardness they need to cope with your everyday activities.

    Your body contains about one kilogram of calcium - 99% of this is in your bones. Most people can get enough calcium through healthy eating alone.

    Foods containing calcium
    Whatever your dietary needs, there are plenty of foods you can eat to get calcium through your diet. Foods rich in calcium include:

    -dairy products, like milk and cheese
    -green leafy vegetables
    -almonds
    -sesame seeds
    -sardines
    -dried fruit
    -pulses
    -tofu
    -fortified foods and drink, like breakfast cereal and alternative milks.

    Vitamin D for bones
    Vitamin D helps your body absorb and use calcium, which gives your bones their strength and hardness.

    There are three ways you can get vitamin D:

    -From sunlight
    -From food
    -From supplements

    Low vitamin D levels could increase your risk of osteoporosis and broken bones. And a severe shortage of vitamin D causes rickets and osteomalacia, which is soft, weak bones.

    Sunlight
    When the sun’s rays fall on your body, they react with your skin to make vitamin D. In the UK, your skin can only get vitamin D from sunlight between March and September. During this time, it's recommended you expose your skin to direct sunlight for around 10 minutes, once or twice per day.

    Give your skin short periods in the sun, without sunscreen, while you're doing short outdoor tasks such as: hanging out the washing, pulling up weeds and walking to the shops.

    Food
    There's a small amount of vitamin D in some foods, but it's difficult to get enough vitamin D from food alone. Foods containing vitamin D include:

    -oily fish, such as herring, salmon and mackerel
    -eggs
    -some pork products
    -lamb's liver
    -fortified bread
    -fortified yoghurts
    -specially processed mushrooms.

You get slammed with a huge work project, you find yourself taking care of sick kids (or parents), or you spend all day running errands. Whatever the reason, life often leaves us no time (or energy!) to prepare meals. So you swing by the drive-thru or phone for a pizza, which leaves you feeling bloated and discouraged about ever eating healthy again.

    You’re right to be concerned. “A diet that’s high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar can lead to obesity , elevated blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure — all of which are risk factors for heart disease,” says Isatu Isuk, R.D., L.D.N., a dietitian at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. But there are ways you can whip up wholesome meals at home without investing tons of time planning meals or grocery shopping. You can also eat healthier when you’re on the go. Isuk recommends these strategies to help you stay on track even when you’re feeling frazzled.
    
    Healthy Restaurant Options
    Many restaurants now offer lighter fare on their menus, often with calorie counts. Take a quick look at restaurant menus online to see which ones provide the best options before you head out. Then consider these tips when ordering:
    
    1. Eat a small salad or broth-based soup first. It’s a nutritious and filling start to your meal that will help you consume fewer calories overall.
    2. Choose veggie-based entrees or those with baked, broiled or grilled fish or skinless chicken.
    3. Look for meals that aren’t greasy or oily. For example, instead of ordering cheese-covered chicken enchiladas, get the grilled chicken or fish tacos. Choose food items without creamy sauces or gravies.
    4. Ask to substitute veggies or salad for fattening sides such as fries, coleslaw or butter-laden mashed potatoes.
    
    Portions served at restaurants can be too big. See if smaller portions are available. Restaurants often offer “half” salads or sandwiches upon request. If not, ask for a doggie bag and be prepared to take home one-third to half of the meal.
    If you crave dessert, opt for fresh fruit or sorbet.

    Better Fast-Food Choices
    Eating fast food doesn’t mean you have to down a fatty cheeseburger and salty fries. These days, there are a variety of menu options where you can find healthier picks. Many fast-food restaurants also have their menus, with calorie counts, online.
    
    Smart picks for a quick and easy meal are places where you have more control over what goes into your order. At a sandwich shop, it’s easy to make healthy adjustments such as no mayo, extra veggies and whole wheat bread. (Plus, they also often have salads and soups.) Ethnic eateries that offer build-your-own bowls, vegetarian options or grilled meat and vegetable plates are good bets, too.
    
    But if you’re passing through a traditional drive-thru, keep these tips in mind:
    
    Avoid fried food (e.g., french fries, onion rings, chicken strips and nuggets).
    A grilled skinless chicken breast sandwich is lower in saturated fat than a burger.
    Order the smallest sizes — don’t “supersize” anything. Ordering the kid’s menu version of your favorite fast food can give you the taste you crave with far fewer calories.
    Skip calorie-heavy sides and toppings.
    Bypass sugary drinks in favor of water, unsweetened tea, or fat-free or low-fat milk.

    Convenient Home-Cooked Meal Kits
    If the time it takes to gather recipes, plan what you’re going to eat for a week and grocery shop is what’s holding you back from eating healthy meals at home, there’s an easy solution: meal subscription boxes.
    
    There are more than 100 different companies that box up multiple meals’ worth of groceries and deliver them to your house each week. Sure, the cost is more than if you did the meal planning and shopping yourself, but many find the convenience worth it. When your meal box is delivered, you can just throw the premeasured ingredients together and follow the cooking instructions to get portion-controlled, tasty dinners on the table in minutes. You get to choose from a constantly rotating list of recipes. Many companies offer low-carb, low-calorie, gluten-free or vegetarian options as well. And you avoid buying ingredients that go unused and sit in the fridge.
    
    “Whether you’re dining out or eating in, it’s important to think about a balanced diet,” says Isuk. “That means making sure you’re getting a good mix of lean protein, vegetables, fruits, whole grains and healthy low-fat dairy.”
